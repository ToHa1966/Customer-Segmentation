 # Customer Segmentation
This project is part of the Udacity Machine Learning Introduction Nanodegree program.

### Project Status
Completed

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to practice skills in data wrangling and unsupervised machine learning.

## Project Description
In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques on two data sets. One has demographic information about the general population of Germany. The other has the same information for customers of a company. After preprocessing the general population data set I did dimensionality reduction and clustered the general population. I also applied the same methods to the customer data set. Afterwards I compared the segments to see differences between the two data sets and retrieve information for strategic and marketing decisions.
